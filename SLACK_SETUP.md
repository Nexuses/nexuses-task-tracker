# Slack Integration Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Slack integration for the task reminder system. You can use either **Incoming Webhooks** (recommended) or **Bot Token** (more flexible).

## Method 1: Incoming Webhook (Recommended - Easier)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to Slack API Apps**
   - Visit: https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Sign in with your Slack workspace

2. **Create a New App**
   - Click **"Create New App"** button
   - Select **"From scratch"**
   - Enter app name: `Task Reminder Bot` (or any name you prefer)
   - Select your workspace
   - Click **"Create App"**

3. **Enable Incoming Webhooks**
   - In the left sidebar, click **"Incoming Webhooks"**
   - Toggle **"Activate Incoming Webhooks"** to **ON**

4. **Add Webhook to Workspace**
   - Scroll down to **"Webhook URLs for Your Workspace"**
   - Click **"Add New Webhook to Workspace"**
   - Select the channel where you want reminders (e.g., `#attendance`)
   - Click **"Allow"**

5. **Copy the Webhook URL**
   - You'll see a webhook URL that looks like:
     ```
     https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/your-webhook-token-here
     ```
   - Click **"Copy"** to copy the URL

6. **Add to Environment Variables**
   - Open your `.env.local` file
   - Add:
     ```
     SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/ACTUAL/WEBHOOK/URL
     SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C0A7J6SSR08
     ```
   - Replace with your actual webhook URL

7. **Restart Your Server**
   - Stop your development server (Ctrl+C)
   - Start it again: `npm run dev`

**✅ Done!** The webhook is pre-configured for your selected channel, so messages will automatically go there.

## Method 2: Bot Token (Alternative - More Flexible)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to Slack API Apps**
   - Visit: https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Sign in with your Slack workspace

2. **Create or Select App**
   - Create a new app (same as Method 1, steps 1-2)
   - OR select an existing app

3. **Configure OAuth & Permissions**
   - In the left sidebar, click **"OAuth & Permissions"**
   - Scroll down to **"Scopes"** section
   - Under **"Bot Token Scopes"**, click **"Add an OAuth Scope"**
   - Add these scopes:
     - `chat:write` - Send messages as the bot
     - `chat:write.public` - Send messages to public channels
     - `users:read` - Read user information (optional, helps with tagging)

4. **Install App to Workspace**
   - Scroll up to **"OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace"**
   - Click **"Install to Workspace"** button
   - Review the permissions
   - Click **"Allow"**

5. **Copy Bot Token** ⚠️ IMPORTANT
   - After installation, you'll see **"Bot User OAuth Token"** section
   - The token MUST start with `xoxb-` (not `xoxp-` or `xoxe-`)
   - It will look like: `xoxb-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   - Click **"Copy"** to copy the token
   - ⚠️ **DO NOT** copy the "User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxp-`) or "OAuth Access Token" (starts with `xoxe-`)
   - ⚠️ You need the **"Bot User OAuth Token"** which starts with `xoxb-`

6. **Get Channel ID**
   - In Slack, right-click on your channel (e.g., `#attendance`)
   - Click **"View channel details"** (or **"Open channel details"**)
   - Scroll down to find **"Channel ID"** (starts with `C`)
   - OR use the channel ID you already have: `C0A7J6SSR08`

7. **Add to Environment Variables**
   - Open your `.env.local` file
   - Add:
     ```
     SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-actual-bot-token-here
     SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=C0A7J6SSR08
     ```
   - Replace with your actual bot token

8. **Restart Your Server**
   - Stop your development server (Ctrl+C)
   - Start it again: `npm run dev`

**✅ Done!** The bot can now send messages to any channel you specify.

## Which Method Should You Use?

### Use **Incoming Webhook (Method 1)** if:
- ✅ You only need to send messages to one channel
- ✅ You want the simplest setup
- ✅ You don't need advanced features

### Use **Bot Token (Method 2)** if:
- ✅ You need to send messages to multiple channels
- ✅ You want more control over message formatting
- ✅ You need to interact with Slack API features

## Testing Your Setup

1. Go to any employee dashboard in the admin panel
2. Click **"Send Test Slack"** button
3. Check your Slack channel - you should see a message with the employee tagged

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to send Slack message" Error

1. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Make sure `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` or `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is set
   - Restart your server after adding environment variables

2. **Verify Webhook URL Format**
   - Should start with: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/`
   - Should have 3 parts separated by `/`

3. **Check Bot Permissions** (for Bot Token method)
   - Make sure bot has `chat:write` scope
   - Make sure bot is installed to your workspace

4. **Check Channel ID** (for Bot Token method)
   - Make sure the channel ID is correct
   - The bot must be a member of the channel

5. **Check Server Logs**
